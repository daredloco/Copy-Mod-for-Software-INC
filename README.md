## Usage:

2) If the application can't find your Software Inc installation, it will redirect you to the Settings tab where you can set the Software Inc Directory manually.
3) Choose if you want to copy a data mod or a code mod.
4) Select a mod from the list on the left side or create a new one by entering the details and press "Save Mod".
5) To copy a mod just choose the mod you want to copy from the list and press "Copy Mod"
6) To copy all mods from the list press "Copy all Mods"
7) To delete the mod from the application just press "Delete Mod". No source files will be deleted, only the project file inside the application.

## Usage:
1) If you have Software Inc installed with Steam, it will find the DLLmods directory for you
1.1) If you didn't install Software Inc with Steam, set the "Destination Directory" to {STEAM INSTALLATION FOLDER}\DLLMods\ (You can double click on the textbox)
2) Set the Source Directory to the directory where your mod project is in (You can double click on the textbox)
3) Choose which files you want to include in the copy process
4) Choose if you want to overwrite the files inside the mod directory
5) Click the "Copy" button to copy the files to the mod directory, after the process an explorer window will open to show you the directory where the mod has been copied to.
Hint: The settings will be saved as soon as you click on the "Copy" button, so next time when you open it it will already have your settings and you won't need to add it again
